🎨 HOW TO ADD YOUR BACKGROUND IMAGE
=====================================

SUPER SIMPLE - 2 STEPS:

1. Save your background image as:
   hero-bg.jpg

2. Put it in the same folder as index.html

That's it! Refresh the page and your image will appear! ✨

The image will show behind the text with a purple overlay.

Your folder should look like:
  📁 your-folder/
    📄 index.html
    📄 style.css  
    📄 script.js
    🖼️ hero-bg.jpg  ← YOUR IMAGE HERE
    📄 other files...

ALTERNATIVE: Use an online image URL

1. Open style.css
2. Find line ~18 (the .hero section)
3. Replace 'hero-bg.jpg' with your image URL:
   
   url('https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg')
